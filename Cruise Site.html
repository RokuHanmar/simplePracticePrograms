    <h2><u>Our Story</u></h2>
<p> Established in 1892, The Staley Cruise Company was the vision of the great entrepreneur Gerald Staley. When he
    started The Staley Cruise Company, Gerald had nothing but a dream and six million pounds. Gerald's first nautical
    experience was as a young boy in the summer of 1882, when he went sailing with his father, Arnold. Together, the two set sail on a
    small rowboat named the Venus de Milo (after the famous statue). Their objective was to cross the lake Barov,
    and the journey was expected to take no more than 2 hours. However, tragedy struck when a hole in the boat
    caused it to sink. Bravely, Gerald saved himself and his father, and from that moment he knew his destiny was
    to own a fleet of cruise ships.</p>

<p> Gerald worked his entire life to make his dream a reality, and he eventually became a big success in the field
    of reasonably priced cruises. However, tragedy struck in the Spring of 1912, when a small ship called the
    Titanic sank. This disaster caused a worldwide recession in the cruise industry, and Gerald was forced to adapt.
    Believing sea travel to be a thing of the past, Gerald chose to subsidise a small business known for making
    airships, and became the first person to offer cheap air travel to the masses. This revitalised his career, and
    Gerald's business once again took off. Unfortunately, disaster would strike again in the Spring of 1937, when
    the fall of the Hindenburg caused stocks in his air travel company to crash and burn.</p>
